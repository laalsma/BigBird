# BigBird
A Python program to store observations of birds in a so-called 'life list' named life_list.csv.

To correctly identify a bird that is entered, it is checked against the Clements Checklist v2023, which can be found here: https://www.birds.cornell.edu/clementschecklist/introduction/updateindex/october-2023/download/

## How to use BigBird?

- Run BigBird.py and follow the prompts to add birds to life_list.csv.
- After observations have been stored, analysis can be performed. There are examples of different quantities of interest in the notebook bird_analysis_notebook.ipynb.

As an example, some observations by Alice, Bob and Charlie have already be added to the life list. If you want to create a new life list, first delete those entries.
